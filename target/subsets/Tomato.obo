def: "A plant embryo development stage (PO:0007631) that occurs during the interval between the beginning of rapid elongation of the plant embryo axis (PO:0019018) and plant embryo cotyledons (PO:0025470), and the onset of a plant embryo true leaf formation stage (PO:0001095), when present, or a mature plant embryo stage (PO:0001081)." [GO:0016049, GO:0051301, POC:Laurel_Cooper, POC:Ramona_Walls, TAIR:Katica_Ilic]
comment: During this stage, the plant embryo (PO:0009009) continues to undergo a process of developmental growth (as a result of both cell division (GO:0051301) and cell expansion (GO:0016049), which ends with the onset of a mature plant embryo stage (PO:0001081). For species that develop true leaves in the plant embryo, (vascular leaves (PO:0009025) that develop after the cotyledons (PO:0020030) or coleoptile (PO:0020033)), growth may continue in the plant embryo true leaf formation stage (PO:0001095). For other species, the plant embryo transitions directly from a plant embryo cotyledonary stage (PO:0001078) to a mature plant embryo stage (PO:0001081).

comment: Many species have juvenile leaves at the base of the stem, adult leaves at the apex, and transition leaves in between. In maize, juvenile leaves are at the tip of the stalk (stem), which differentiates first, with adult leaves at the base, while other grasses may have other arrangements. The first juvenile leaves in Poaceae are the embryonic leaves found in the grass kernel (caryopsis).

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually found underground, although there are many exceptions, such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

In ferns, lateral root primordia develop from the endodermis.

[POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.

def: "The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P." [POC:Laurel_Cooper]
comment: Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
