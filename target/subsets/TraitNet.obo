comment: Companion cells are connected to sieve tube elements through plasmodesmata and function in phloem loading of small molecules, including photosynthate (either sucrose or raffinose-family oligosaccharides). May participate in phloem sucrose loading (GO:0009915). Molecules can be loaded into the companion cells from surrounding cells through either symplastic (via plasmodesmata) or apoplastic (transmembrane) transport. Unlike sieve tube elements, companion cells retain their nuclei and other organelles at maturity. A sieve tube element may have one or more or no companion cells associated with it. This term should not be used for other types of parenchyma cells (PO:0000074) that do not arise from the same phloem mother cell as a sieve tube element. Companion cells are found in angiosperms, as compared to albuminous cells (PO:0025412), which are found in non-angiosperm vascular plants. Companion cells may be specialized as transfer companion cells (PO:0025458), ordinary companion cells (PO:0025459), or intermediary companion cells (PO:0025460). Multiple types of companion cells may be found in the same plant.

Tracheary elements function in the conduction of water and dissolved substances such as mineral nutrients from the roots to the shoot system.

comment: Commonly thick walled, with pointed ends and bordered pits that have lenticular to slit-like apertures. If both libriform fibers (PO:0004520) and fiber tracheids are present, the libriform fibers usually have thicker walls. Fiber tracheids have bordered pits with smaller pit cavities than the vessel members (PO:0002003) or tracheids (PO:0000301) of the same wood and a distinct pit cavity leading from the pit cavity to the cell lumen through the thick cell wall.

def: "A branch that is slender, prostrate or trailing and above-ground and produces roots and sometimes erect shoots at its nodes." [APweb:Glossary, POC:curators]
comment: The stolon develops from an axillary bud and produces adventitious roots at the nodes and a terminal aerial stem. That stem then sends out one or more stolons from its axillary buds and the process is reiterated. A unique part of this process is that the first internode of a stolon is very long and then the shoot becomes an erect rosette.

May be organized into axial (PO:0025410) and ray (PO:0025411) systems. Secondary xylem is often part of a shoot axis (PO:0025029) or a root (PO:0009005) but may occur in other organs. Some monocots have a primary thickening meristem (PO:0005039), located near the shoot apical meristem (PO:0020148), that gives the appearance of secondary growth and may produce lignified tissue that appears woody but is not composed of secondary xylem.

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually found underground, although there are many exceptions, such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

comment: In some cases, a gynoecium (PO:0009062) may consist of only one carpel, in which case annotations should go on carpel (PO:0009030). The word pistil is used synonymously with gynoecium, but if a gynoecium consists of a single carpel, then pistil may be used synonymously with carpel. If carpels are fused, the gynoecium is a syncarpous gynoecium, as in Poaceae, Brassicaceae and Solanaceae. If carpels are free, the gynoecium is an apocarpous gynoecium, as in Fabaceae. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352), tassel floret (PO:0006310), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006314), upper floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006316).

comment: If annotating gene expression to a gynoecium with a single carpel (PO:0009030), the annotation should go on carpel. A gynoecium with two or more carpels may be either syncarpous (carpels fused) or apopcarpous (carpels free) or the carpels may be partially fused. The word pistil is used synonymously with gynoecium for a synocarpous gynoecium, and synonymously with carpel for an apocarpous gynoecium, whether it has one or more carpels. In Zea mays, gynoecia of tassel florets and of the lower florets of ear spikelets usually do not develop fully, and they are present in a rudimentary state. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays or other grasses, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type.

comment: A whole plant (PO:0000003) in the sporophyte development stage usually has twice the chromosome complement of a plant in the gametophytic phase, but may not in the case of apogamy. Examples of apogamy include both naturally occurring instances (such as sporophytes arising form haploid cells as in bryophytes or ferns) as well as in vitro instances (such as haploid embryo culture or in vitro fusion of non-gamete cells or protoplasts). During the sporophyte development stage, a plant may produce meiospores by meiosis.

def: "A whole plant development stage (PO:0007033) that has as primary participant a whole plant (PO:0000003) during the interval between meiosis or apospory and the time that the whole plant ceases to exist." [POC:curators]
comment: In bryophytes and pteridophytes, a gametophytic phase may begin without meiosis by apospory. This usually occurs when damage to a plant in the sporophytic phase leads directly to the growth of a plant that is in the gametophyte development stage but bears the chromosome complement that would normally be found in the sporophyte development stage (PO:0028002). A whole plant in the gametophyte development stage usually has half the chromosome complement of a plant in the sporophyte development stage, but not in the case of apospory. A whole plant in the gametophyte development stage may cease to exist by death at any point in its development. In seed plants, the whole plant in the gametophyte development stage may cease to exists through transformation, such as when pollen (PO:0025281) releases its pollen sperm cells (PO:0025121) or when a plant embryo (PO:0009009) begins to develop within an embryo sac (PO:0025074) of an angiosperm. During the gametophytic phase, a plant may produce gametes (PO:0025006) by mitosis.

def: "A derives_by_manipulation_from B means: A is a type of in vitro plant structure, and every instance of A exists at a point in time later than some instance of B from which it was created through human manipulation, and every instance of A inherited a biologically significant portion of its matter from the instance of B from which it was derived." [POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.

def: "The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P." [POC:Laurel_Cooper]
comment: Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
