def: "A vascular leaf that is distinct from adult leaves, being characterized by particular anatomical traits namely, wax and trichome distribution, presence or absence of epidermal cell types, cell wall shape and biochemistry." [GR:Pankaj_Jaiswal, MaizeGDB:lv]
comment: Many species have juvenile leaves at the base of the stem, adult leaves at the apex, and transition leaves in between. In maize, juvenile leaves are at the tip of the stalk (stem), which differentiates first, with adult leaves at the base, while other grasses may have other arrangements. The first juvenile leaves in Poaceae are the embryonic leaves found in the grass kernel (caryopsis).

[PMID:2152125, POC:curators, POC:Laurel_Cooper]
comment: In most species, flowering stage (anthesis) is when the flower is open and ends with pollination.  During this stage, the process of anther dehiscence (GO:0009901) usually occurs, defined as the dehiscence of an anther to release the pollen grains contained within it.

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually found underground, although there are many exceptions, such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

From APweb Glossary: In angiosperms, commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the seed plant body, a structure usually of determinate growth, without secondary thickening, and of superficial origin, often flattened and photosynthetic in part, and in the axil of which is found a bud. Occurs in the sporophytic phase of a plant life cycle.

def: "A shoot axis that extends from the last foliage leaf on a stem or branch until the next distal node." [ISBN:9781842464229, POC:curators]
comment: In plants with single flowers, the peduncle ends with a flower. In plants with inflorescences, the peduncle is the basal end of the primary inflorescence axis, and it ends where the inflorescence begins to branch. The peduncle marks the axial transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. In branching inflorescences, the second order inflorescence axis from the point at which it leaves the main axis up to the point at which it branches again may be called the second order peduncle. Higher order peduncles are also possible.

comment: If you are annotating to this term, please add an additional annotation to vascular leaf (PO:0009025) or non-vascular leaf (PO:0025075), depending on the species. All annotations for angiosperms, gymnosperms, and pteridophytes should go to vascular leaf and all annotations for bryophytes should go to non-vascular leaf.

def: "A derives_by_manipulation_from B means: A is a type of in vitro plant structure, and every instance of A exists at a point in time later than some instance of B from which it was created through human manipulation, and every instance of A inherited a biologically significant portion of its matter from the instance of B from which it was derived." [POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.

def: "The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P." [POC:Laurel_Cooper]
comment: Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
