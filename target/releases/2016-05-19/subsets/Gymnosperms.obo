name: adult vascular leaf
namespace: plant_anatomy
def: "A vascular leaf characterized by particular anatomical traits namely, wax and trichome distribution, presence or absence of epidermal cell types, cell wall shape and biochemistry." [GR:Pankaj_Jaiswal, MaizeGDB:lv]
comment: Many species have juvenile leaves at the base of the stem, adult leaves at the apex, and transition leaves in between. In maize, juvenile leaves are at the tip of the stalk (stem), which differentiates first, with adult leaves at the base, while other grasses may have other arrangements. In some plants the juvenile leaves may go on to establish as adult leaves.

[PMID:2152125, POC:curators, POC:Laurel_Cooper]
comment: In most species, flowering stage (anthesis) is when the flower is open and ends with pollination.  During this stage, the process of anther dehiscence (GO:0009901) usually occurs, defined as the dehiscence of an anther to release the pollen grains contained within it. This term applies to an individual flower (PO:000904).

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually found underground, although there are many exceptions, such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

comment: A lateral root primordium may develops on any root, including a primary root (PO:0020127), on an existing lateral root (PO:0020121), or a shoot-borne root (PO:0000042). In seed plants, a lateral root primordium generally develops from pericycle cells (PO:0025261), but cells of an endodermis (PO:0000252) may also participate in its formation in some species. In ferns, lateral root primordia develop from the endodermis.

def: "A plant sperm cell (PO:0000084) that is part of the pollen (PO:0025281)." [PMID:20298228, POC:curators]
comment: Pollen sperm cells are structurally simple, usually non-motile cells that may contain a normal complement of cellular organelles, including heritable cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and, in some plants, plastids, but lack a cell wall. In seed plants, pollen sperm cells are usually two in number. In angiosperms, during double fertilization, one fuses with the plant egg cell (PO:0020094) to produce a plant zygote (PO:0000423) while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the embryo sac central cell (PO:0020090) to give rise to endosperm (PO:0009089).  In angiosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the generative cell (PO:0020097). In gymnosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the body cell (PO:0025525).

comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.

Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P." [POC:Laurel_Cooper]
comment: Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
