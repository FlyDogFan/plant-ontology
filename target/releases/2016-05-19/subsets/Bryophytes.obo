comment: A carbohydrate and amino acid conducting cell found in bryophytes in axes and leaves in the gametophyte development stage (PO:0028003) and in the seta in the sporophytic phase. Leptoids have no nucleus at maturity. Carbohydrate and amino acid conducting cells in bryophytes range from conducting parenchyma cells that are indistinguishable from other parenchyma cells to 'leptoids sensu strictu' that are structurally comparable to sieve elements in vascular plants, as well as many intermediate forms. The term leptoid is used for cells that are distinguishable from other parenchyma cells, whether they be intermediate or leptoids sensu strictu.

comment: The protonema is the first structure that develops in the gametophytic phase of mosses, some other bryophytes, and leptosporangiate ferns. The term protonema is also used to refer to the phase of development in which protonemal tissue is produced (see PO:0030006 protonema phase). In some species of moss, the protonema is perennial.

comment: Apical cells occur only at the tip of a shoot axis apex, leaf apex, root apex, thallus apex, or protonema in bryophytes and some pteridophytes. Apical growth results from division of a single meristematic cell located at the tip of an apical meristem or plant organ, rather than from a population of meristematic cells located at the tip of an apical meristem. The apical cell may be tetrahedral shaped, with three (in shoots) or four (in roots) cutting faces, or wedge-shaped (lenticular) with two cutting faces (in non-vascular leaves or thalli). An apical cell may be established upon germination of a spore or upon the first cell division of an embryo, or later.

comment: Found in bryophytes. The spore capsule calyptra is a membranous or hairy cap or hood, composed of gametophytic tissue (venter; PO:0030038) that protects the embryonic sporophyte within the archegonium (PO:0025126). In some species, it may persist after the sporophyte develops and gets carried upward as the seta (PO:0030032) elongates. The spore capsule calyptra is usually lost before the spores are released, and its shape can be used for identification purposes.

def: "A protonema sub-apical initial hat gives rise to a gametophore bud." [POC:curators]
comment: In Physcomitrella patens, a gametophore bud initial typically is more bulbous than a protonema side branch initial, and its plane of first cell division is oblique, rather than perpendicular, to the plane of growth.

def: "A portion of plant tissue that is the outer layer or layers of a sporangium early in sporangium development." [ISBN:0962073342]
comment: Term used for bryophytes. May have one or more layers. An amphithecium may give rise to an exothecium and other layers of a sporangium wall (jacket layer or layers). In true mosses, the amphithecium gives rise to the sporangium wall and the peristome. In hornworts and peat mosses, it gives rise to the sporangium wall and sporogenous tissue.

comment: Term used for bryophytes. In liverworts an early sporangium endothecium produces sporogenous tissue. In Sphagnum, Andreaea, and hornworts, it produces columella and sporogenous tissue.

comment: In Physcomitrella patens, non-vascular leaf initials arise from the daughter cells of a gametophore axis apical cell. Subsequent division of a non-vascular leaf initial establishes a non-vascular leaf apical cell.

def: "A derives_by_manipulation_from B means: A is a type of in vitro plant structure, and every instance of A exists at a point in time later than some instance of B from which it was created through human manipulation, and every instance of A inherited a biologically significant portion of its matter from the instance of B from which it was derived." [POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.

def: "The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P." [POC:Laurel_Cooper]
comment: Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
