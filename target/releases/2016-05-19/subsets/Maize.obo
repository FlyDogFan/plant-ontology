comment: Defined by characteristic morphological, structural, histological or other visible features of a fruit. Includes as subclasses fruit formation stage (PO:0025501) and fruit ripening stage (PO:0025502). May have as part a seed development stage (PO:0001170). This stage applies to an individual fruit. For development stages of a whole plant (PO:0000003) based on fruit development, use whole plant fruit development stage (PO:0025500) or its subclasses.

Not all species form true leaves in the plant embryo development stage (PO:0007631).

[Poc:curators]
comment: Succeeds a whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042). This term is to be used for a stage of development of a whole plant. For the stages of development of an individual fruit, see fruit ripening stage (PO:0025502). Although individual fruits are undergoing fruit ripening (GO:0009835), which is a type of senescence, during this stage, the whole plant is not yet undergoing multicelluar organism senescence (GO:0010259). An iteroparous species generally will have only one fruit ripening stage in its life, while a semelparous species may have multiple fruit ripening stage in its life. A whole plant fruit ripening stage may be followed by a sporophyte senescent stage, as in case (1) or by a sporophyte dormant stage (PO:0007132), as in case (2). In evergreen species and species that fruit multiple times during a growing season, a plant may have multiple fruit development stages without entering dormancy or senescence, as in case (3). In plants with continuous (i.e., indeterminate) fruit development (GO:0010154), new fruits may continue to develop after the first fruit has begun to ripen and the whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042) has ended. In some plants, fruit may continue to ripen after the whole plant has entered a sporophyte dormant stage or sporophyte senescent stage and left the whole plant fruit ripening stage. Some plants may never enter a whole plant fruit ripening stage, because fruits only begin to ripen after the plant has entered a sporophyte dormant stage or sporophyte senescent stage. Although the use of synonyms like "10-dough stage in sorghum" properly refer to the development of an individual fruit, they are used as here to extrapolate to a whole plant.

comment: This includes the stage when an inflorescence starts to develop (and is detectable only by assay or with a microscope), to the stage where it is visible to the naked eye. This includes the booting stage in the grasses (Poaceae). There is no one-to-one correspondence between some of the phases of inflorescence formation in members of Poaceae (e.g., booting) with that of other families.

comment: Many species have juvenile leaves at the base of the stem, adult leaves at the apex, and transition leaves in between. In maize, juvenile leaves are at the tip of the stalk (stem), which differentiates first, with adult leaves at the base, while other grasses may have other arrangements. Transition leaves may have mosaics of juvenile and adult tissues, as in Brachypodium.

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually found underground, although there are many exceptions, such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

comment: The androecium also has as parts any staminodes (PO:0009077) that may be present in a flower. If annotating gene expression to an androecium with a single stamen (PO:0009029), the annotation should go on stamen. If you are annotating to this structure for Zea mays, please also add an annotation to the corresponding floret type. Choose the most specific term possible from: spikelet floret (PO:0009082), ear floret (PO:0006354), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006353), lower floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006351), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of ear (PO:0006350), upper floret of sessile spikelet of ear (PO:0006352), tassel floret (PO:0006310), lower floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006313), lower floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006315), upper floret of pedicellate spikelet of tassel (PO:0006314), upper floret of sessile spikelet of tassel (PO:0006316). The development of an androecium in an ear floret of a normal maize plant is aborted and is present in a rudimentary state, while the development of an androecium in a tassel floret leads to a functional androecium.

comment: A lateral root primordium may develops on any root, including a primary root (PO:0020127), on an existing lateral root (PO:0020121), or a shoot-borne root (PO:0000042). In seed plants, a lateral root primordium generally develops from pericycle cells (PO:0025261), but cells of an endodermis (PO:0000252) may also participate in its formation in some species. In ferns, lateral root primordia develop from the endodermis.

[GO:0022611, POC:curators]
comment: During a plant embryo dormant stage, a plant embryo participates in a dormancy process, but not all plant embryos have a dormant stage. A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. In seed plants, a plant embryo dormant stage may be part of a seed dormant stage.

[POC:curators]
comment: A whole plant fruit development stage begins with the beginning of whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042) and ends with the end of a whole plant fruit ripening stage (PO:0007010). A whole plant fruit development stage can be thought of as a fruiting cycle for a whole plant that begins when the plant starts to produce fruit and ends when all of the fruit on the plant are ripe, unless the plant enters a sporophyte senescent stage or sporophyte dormant stage before all the fruit is ripe. An iteroparous plant will have a single whole plant fruit development stage during its life of whole plant (PO:0025337), while a semelparous plant may have multiple whole plant fruit development stages during its life, each of which will be part of the same instance of a sporophyte reproductive stage. Some plants retain their fruit after ripening and through dormancy, and thus may begin a new whole fruit development stage while fruits from the previous whole plant fruit development stage are still present.

[POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.

def: "The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P." [POC:Laurel_Cooper]
comment: Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
