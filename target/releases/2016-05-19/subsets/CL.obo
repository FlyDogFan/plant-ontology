comment: Companion cells are connected to sieve tube elements through plasmodesmata and function in phloem loading of small molecules, including photosynthate (either sucrose or raffinose-family oligosaccharides). May participate in phloem sucrose loading (GO:0009915). Molecules can be loaded into the companion cells from surrounding cells through either symplastic (via plasmodesmata) or apoplastic (transmembrane) transport. Unlike sieve tube elements, companion cells retain their nuclei and other organelles at maturity. A sieve tube element may have one or more or no companion cells associated with it. This term should not be used for other types of parenchyma cells (PO:0000074) that do not arise from the same phloem mother cell as a sieve tube element. Companion cells are found in angiosperms, as compared to albuminous cells (PO:0025412), which are found in non-angiosperm vascular plants. Companion cells may be specialized as transfer companion cells (PO:0025458), ordinary companion cells (PO:0025459), or intermediary companion cells (PO:0025460). Multiple types of companion cells may be found in the same plant.

comment: May be dead at maturity. The secondary cell wall of a sclerenchyma cell is often thicker than other cell types in the same plant structure, but it is not always easy to distinguish from tracheary elements (PO:0000290) or sclerified parenchyma cells (PO:0000074). Compare with collenchyma cells (PO:0000075) that are always alive at maturity, have irregularly thickened primary cell walls, and do not have lignified secondary cell walls. Collenchyma cells provides flexibility while sclerenchyma cells provide hardness. Sclerenchyma cells include plant fiber cells (PO:0025407) and sclerid cells (PO:0025418).

def: "A fiber cell (PO:0025407) that is part of a portion of xylem (PO:0005352) tissue." [ISBN:0471245208]
comment: It may be difficult to distinguish xylem fiber cells, especially fiber tracheids (PO:0000355), from tracheary elements (PO:0000290). Fiber tracheids have bordered pits with smaller pit cavities than the vessel members (PO:0002003) or tracheids (PO:0000301) of the same wood and a distinct pit cavity leading to the cell lumen through the cell wall.

comment: Sieve tube elements have sieve areas that are specialized into those with wide pores in sieve plates and those with narrow pores in lateral sieve areas.

comment: Tracheary elements are dead at maturity, are more or less elongated, and have pits of various types in the cell wall. Tracheary elements function in the conduction of water and dissolved substances such as mineral nutrients from the roots to the shoot system. Tracheary elements can be distinguished from fiber cells (PO:0025407) by the presence of bordered pits, although there are intermediate forms called fiber tracheids (PO:0000355).

comment: Found in heterosporous ferns and seed plants. May also give rise to sterile cells. In the majority of flowering plants, including Arabidopsis, the female archesporial cell elongates and polarizes longitudinally, and directly differentiates into the megasporocyte or megaspore mother cell. In some flowering plants, it undergoes a periclinal division, and subsequently the inner cell differentiates into the megasporocyte.

comment: A carbohydrate and amino acid conducting cell found in bryophytes in axes and leaves in the gametophyte development stage (PO:0028003) and in the seta in the sporophytic phase. Leptoids have no nucleus at maturity. Carbohydrate and amino acid conducting cells in bryophytes range from conducting parenchyma cells that are indistinguishable from other parenchyma cells to 'leptoids sensu strictu' that are structurally comparable to sieve elements in vascular plants, as well as many intermediate forms. The term leptoid is used for cells that are distinguishable from other parenchyma cells, whether they be intermediate or leptoids sensu strictu.

comment: Pollen sperm cells are structurally simple, usually non-motile cells that may contain a normal complement of cellular organelles, including heritable cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and, in some plants, plastids, but lack a cell wall. In seed plants, pollen sperm cells are usually two in number. In angiosperms, during double fertilization, one fuses with the plant egg cell (PO:0020094) to produce a plant zygote (PO:0000423) while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the embryo sac central cell (PO:0020090) to give rise to endosperm (PO:0009089).  In angiosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the generative cell (PO:0020097). In gymnosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the body cell (PO:0025525).

comment: Apical cells occur only at the tip of a shoot axis apex, leaf apex, root apex, thallus apex, or protonema in bryophytes and some pteridophytes. Apical growth results from division of a single meristematic cell located at the tip of an apical meristem or plant organ, rather than from a population of meristematic cells located at the tip of an apical meristem. The apical cell may be tetrahedral shaped, with three (in shoots) or four (in roots) cutting faces, or wedge-shaped (lenticular) with two cutting faces (in non-vascular leaves or thalli). An apical cell may be established upon germination of a spore or upon the first cell division of an embryo, or later.

comment: May give rise to a branch of the protonema (including a protonema rhizoid, tmema cell or brachycyte), a gametophore bud, or may not divide further.

def: "An initial cell (PO:0004011) that is part of a gametophore (PO:0030018) and gives rise to a non-vascular leaf (PO:0025075)." [PMID:19303301]
comment: In Physcomitrella patens, non-vascular leaf initials arise from the daughter cells of a gametophore axis apical cell. Subsequent division of a non-vascular leaf initial establishes a non-vascular leaf apical cell.

def: "A derives_by_manipulation_from B means: A is a type of in vitro plant structure, and every instance of A exists at a point in time later than some instance of B from which it was created through human manipulation, and every instance of A inherited a biologically significant portion of its matter from the instance of B from which it was derived." [POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.

def: "The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P." [POC:Laurel_Cooper]
comment: Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
