Sieve tube elements may have inclined end walls with compound or simple sieve plates. Typical of angiosperms. Differ from sieve cells (PO:0025415), which have less pronounced specialization of sieve areas and no sieve plates.

comment: During this stage, the plant embryo (PO:0009009) continues to undergo a process of developmental growth (as a result of both cell division (GO:0051301) and cell expansion (GO:0016049), which ends with the onset of a mature plant embryo stage (PO:0001081). For species that develop true leaves in the plant embryo, (vascular leaves (PO:0009025) that develop after the cotyledons (PO:0020030) or coleoptile (PO:0020033)), growth may continue in the plant embryo true leaf formation stage (PO:0001095).

comment: May be a single or double layer. Usually crushed by the endothecium and therefore almost invariably degenerates early during anther development. In some angiosperms, including <i>Arabidopsis</i>, it develops from an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer. In other angiosperms, it develops directly from an anther wall primary parietal cell layer, while in still others, two layers of the middle layer may develop from both an anther wall outer secondary parietal cell layer and an anther wall inner secondary parietal cell layer.

[Poc:curators]
comment: Succeeds a whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042). This term is to be used for a stage of development of a whole plant. For the stages of development of an individual fruit, see fruit ripening stage (PO:0025502). Although individual fruits are undergoing fruit ripening (GO:0009835), which is a type of senescence, during this stage, the whole plant is not yet undergoing multicelluar organism senescence (GO:0010259). An iteroparous species generally will have only one fruit ripening stage in its life, while a semelparous species may have multiple fruit ripening stage in its life. A whole plant fruit ripening stage may be followed by a sporophyte senescent stage, as in case (1) or by a sporophyte dormant stage (PO:0007132), as in case (2). In evergreen species and species that fruit multiple times during a growing season, a plant may have multiple fruit development stages without entering dormancy or senescence, as in case (3). In plants with continuous (i.e., indeterminate) fruit development (GO:0010154), new fruits may continue to develop after the first fruit has begun to ripen and the whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042) has ended. In some plants, fruit may continue to ripen after the whole plant has entered a sporophyte dormant stage or sporophyte senescent stage and left the whole plant fruit ripening stage. Some plants may never enter a whole plant fruit ripening stage, because fruits only begin to ripen after the plant has entered a sporophyte dormant stage or sporophyte senescent stage. Although the use of synonyms like "10-dough stage in sorghum" properly refer to the development of an individual fruit, they are used as here to extrapolate to a whole plant.

comment: This term is to be used for a stage of development of a whole plant (PO:0000003). For the stages of development of an individual fruit, see fruit development stage (PO:0001002). An iteroparous plant will only have one fruit formation stage in its life,  while a semelparous plant may have multiple whole plant fruit formation stages during its life. In plants with continuous (i.e., indeterminate) fruit development (GO:0010154), new fruits may continue to develop after the first fruit has begun to ripen and the fruit ripening stage of whole plant (PO:0007042) has begun. Although the use of synonyms like "07-milk stage in rice" properly refer to the development of an individual fruits, they are used as here to extrapolate to a whole plant.

This includes the booting stage in the grasses (Poaceae). There is no one-to-one correspondence between some of the phases of inflorescence formation in members of Poaceae (e.g., booting) with that of other families.

In maize, juvenile leaves are at the tip of the stalk (stem), which differentiates first, with adult leaves at the base, while other grasses may have other arrangements.

comment: Roots function in the absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, anchoring the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, storage of food and nutrients, and vegetative reproduction. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with soil-borne microorganisms. Roots are usually found underground, although there are many exceptions, such as the aerial roots of orchids. Roots often form secondary thickening from the root lateral meristem (PO:0006308). Commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the plant body, along with the shoot axis (PO:0025029) and leaves (PO:0025034).

comment: Has vascular tissue. From APweb Glossary: In angiosperms, commonly thought of as one of the three basic parts of the seed plant body, a structure usually of determinate growth, without secondary thickening, and of superficial origin, often flattened and photosynthetic in part, and in the axil of which is found a bud. Occurs in the sporophytic phase of a plant life cycle.

comment: In plants with single flowers, the peduncle ends with a flower. In plants with inflorescences, the peduncle is the basal end of the primary inflorescence axis, and it ends where the inflorescence begins to branch. The peduncle marks the axial transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. In branching inflorescences, the second order inflorescence axis from the point at which it leaves the main axis up to the point at which it branches again may be called the second order peduncle. Higher order peduncles are also possible.

comment: A lateral root primordium may develops on any root, including a primary root (PO:0020127), on an existing lateral root (PO:0020121), or a shoot-borne root (PO:0000042). In seed plants, a lateral root primordium generally develops from pericycle cells (PO:0025261), but cells of an endodermis (PO:0000252) may also participate in its formation in some species. In ferns, lateral root primordia develop from the endodermis.

comment: Pollen sperm cells are structurally simple, usually non-motile cells that may contain a normal complement of cellular organelles, including heritable cytoplasmic organelles such as mitochondria and, in some plants, plastids, but lack a cell wall. In seed plants, pollen sperm cells are usually two in number. In angiosperms, during double fertilization, one fuses with the plant egg cell (PO:0020094) to produce a plant zygote (PO:0000423) while another fuses with the two polar nuclei of the embryo sac central cell (PO:0020090) to give rise to endosperm (PO:0009089).  In angiosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the generative cell (PO:0020097). In gymnosperms, the pollen sperm cell arises from the body cell (PO:0025525).

[GO:0022611, POC:curators]
comment: During a plant embryo dormant stage, a plant embryo participates in a dormancy process, but not all plant embryos have a dormant stage. A dormancy process (GO:0022611) is a developmental process in which dormancy (sometimes called a dormant state) is induced, maintained or broken. Dormancy is a suspension of most physiological activity and growth that can be reactivated. In seed plants, a plant embryo dormant stage may be part of a seed dormant stage.

comment: Develops as a response to gravity (tension) and may function in restoring a stem (PO:0009047) or branch (PO:0025073) that is leaning to its original position. Found in angiosperms. Secondary xylem tracheary elements (PO:0025445) in tension wood are often longer than the tracheary elements in non-tension wood of the same plant. The gelatinous fiber cells found in reaction wood have a cell wall inner layer (G layer) that contains abundant cellulose and is poor in lignin.

[POC:curators]
comment: A whole plant fruit development stage begins with the beginning of whole plant fruit formation stage (PO:0007042) and ends with the end of a whole plant fruit ripening stage (PO:0007010). A whole plant fruit development stage can be thought of as a fruiting cycle for a whole plant that begins when the plant starts to produce fruit and ends when all of the fruit on the plant are ripe, unless the plant enters a sporophyte senescent stage or sporophyte dormant stage before all the fruit is ripe. An iteroparous plant will have a single whole plant fruit development stage during its life of whole plant (PO:0025337), while a semelparous plant may have multiple whole plant fruit development stages during its life, each of which will be part of the same instance of a sporophyte reproductive stage. Some plants retain their fruit after ripening and through dormancy, and thus may begin a new whole fruit development stage while fruits from the previous whole plant fruit development stage are still present.

[POC:curators]
comment: The derives_by_manipulation_from relation, is a special case of the RO relation derives_from.  Derives_from implies an instance level derivation that holds between two distinct material continuants when one succeeds the other across a temporal divide in such a way that at least a biologically significant portion of the matter of the earlier continuant is inherited by the later.  Likewise, derives_by_manipulation_from joins two plant structures before and after some manipulation.  Specifically, derives_by_manipulation_from is used to describe the relation between an in vitro plant structure and the in vivo plant structure that is its temporal precursor.

def: "The assertion P preceded_by P1 tells us something about Ps in general: that is, it tells us something about what happened earlier, given what we know about what happened later. Thus it does not provide information pointing in the opposite direction, concerning instances of P1 in general; that is, that each is such as to be succeeded by some instance of P." [POC:Laurel_Cooper]
comment: Note that an assertion to the effect that P preceded_by P1 is rather weak; it tells us little about the relations between the underlying instances in virtue of which the preceded_by relation obtains. Typically we will be interested in stronger relations, for example in the relation immediately_preceded_by, or in relations which combine preceded_by with a condition to the effect that the corresponding instances of P and P1 share participants, or that their participants are connected by relations of derivation, or (as a first step along the road to a treatment of causality) that the one process in some way affects (for example, initiates or regulates) the other.
